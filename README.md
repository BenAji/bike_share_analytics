### Introduction
In this case study, I performed real-world tasks of a data analyst. I answered the key business questions, following the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze,
share, and act using python program on jupyter notebook. Along the way, the Case Study Roadmap tables — including guiding questions and key tasks — will help organize the path.<br>
This is a portfolio for this case study including all code used which can be duplicated.
<br>This is a demonstration of what i am capable of doing or replicate in any business case, so it is a testament of my knowledge and skills in data analysis using python programming.
